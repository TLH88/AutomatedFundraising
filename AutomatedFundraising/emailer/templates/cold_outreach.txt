Subject: Partnering to Give Every Animal a Second Chance | {{org_name}}

Hi {{contact_name}},

My name is {{sender_name}}, and I'm reaching out on behalf of Furry Friends Shelter — a nonprofit dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming animals in need across Washington State.

I came across {{org_name}} and was genuinely moved by {{org_reason}}. That kind of commitment reflects the values we hold deeply at our shelter.

We're currently running our {{fundraiser_name}} campaign, and we're reaching out to a select group of organizations whose values align with ours — to explore whether a partnership might be a fit. That could look like a direct donation, in-kind support, or co-promoting our campaign to your audience.

Here's the direct impact of a contribution:

  $50 — provides one week of medical care for a rescued animal
  $250 — covers a full month of shelter and feeding for a senior dog
  $500 — funds a spay/neuter procedure that prevents future suffering

Every dollar goes directly to the animals.

I'd love to connect — even a 15-minute call would mean the world to us (and to a few wagging tails). If now isn't the right time, I completely understand, and I'm happy to stay in touch for when it might be.

With deep gratitude,
