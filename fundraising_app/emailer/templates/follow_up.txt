Subject: One Quick Follow-Up — Furry Friends Shelter & {{org_name}}

---

Hi {{contact_name}},

I wanted to follow up on my note from last week about Furry Friends Shelter's {{fundraiser_name}} campaign.

I know how full inboxes get, so I'll keep this short: we're a small shelter with a big mission, and we're looking for a handful of partners who share our belief that every animal deserves a second chance.

If there's any interest from {{org_name}} — even at a small level — it would make a meaningful difference. And if the timing simply isn't right, that's completely okay too. I'd rather build a genuine relationship than push for anything that doesn't feel right.

Either way, thank you for the work {{org_name}} does. It matters.

With appreciation,
